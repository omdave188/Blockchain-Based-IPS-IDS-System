A blockchain-powered IPS/IDS system with OTP authentication and real-time intrusion alerts.

This project is a blockchain-based Intrusion Prevention and Detection System (IPS/IDS) that combines the power of Ethereum smart contracts with a real-time monitoring system to enhance login security. It ensures that user registration and authentication are handled in a secure and transparent way using blockchain technology while continuously monitoring for suspicious login attempts. The system provides an added layer of defense by sending detailed security alerts whenever multiple failed login attempts are detected.

The system is divided into three main components. The registration module (register_user.py) allows users to register by storing their identity details—such as name, email, and phone number—securely on the Ethereum blockchain. Each user is assigned a unique ID which is logged in the system. The login module (new_logiiin.py) uses blockchain-generated OTPs for authentication. OTPs are securely sent to the user’s registered email, and only when the OTP is validated on the blockchain is the login considered successful. All login attempts, whether successful or failed, are logged into user_logs.txt.

The alert system (alert.py) acts as the IDS/IPS layer. It monitors the user_logs.txt file in real time and detects multiple failed login attempts. If three consecutive failed attempts occur for a single user, the system automatically collects detailed system and network information such as hostname, IP addresses, MAC address, ISP, operating system, and uptime. This information is then sent via email to the administrator, helping to quickly identify and prevent possible intrusions. The email credentials and environment configurations for this system are stored in cred.env, while the contract_abi.json file contains the ABI for the deployed smart contract on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

The project leverages Python, Web3.py, psutil, requests, and smtplib for its backend, and the Ethereum blockchain (Sepolia testnet) for secure identity management and OTP generation. Together, these components form a hybrid security solution where blockchain provides trust and immutability, while the IDS/IPS layer ensures proactive monitoring and prevention of unauthorized access.

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be used beyond financial transactions to strengthen cybersecurity systems, particularly in identity management and intrusion detection. In the future, it can be enhanced by integrating machine learning for anomaly detection, deploying the smart contract on a private blockchain for enterprise adoption, or adding multi-factor authentication such as biometrics or hardware tokens.
